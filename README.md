# Elevation Plotter
This python script will take in a height map image and generate a cool-looking graphic based on that elevation data. 
I was healivily inspired by [u/newishtodc's](https://www.reddit.com/user/newishtodc/) work on [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) (I basically copied what he did in R, but in python). The script is heavily customizable, feel free tweak the parameters at your liking!

# Example
Here's an example using a heightmap of Australia found [here](http://i.imgur.com/Sc2wB.jpg)
