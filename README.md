# Elevation Plotter
This python script will take in a height map image and generate a cool-looking graphic based on that elevation data.
I was healivily inspired by [u/newishtodc's](https://www.reddit.com/user/newishtodc/) work on [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) (I basically copied what he did in R, but in python) as well as Vulfpeck's Hillclimber album cover. The script is heavily customizable, feel free tweak the parameters at your liking!

# Example
Here's an example using a heightmap of Australia I found [here](http://i.imgur.com/Sc2wB.jpg)

# How to use
Simple! just download the map.py file, open it up and change the path to the source heightmap image you want to use, and tweak the parameters at the top until you get something you like!
